### 1. Download the starter code
{:.no_toc}

Technically, your newly created assignment is a "GitHub repository."
- This is a private repository, meaning only you (and the course staff) can access it.
- This is basically a private online folder where you will ultimately store your finished homework files. Right now, though, it contains the starter code for the assignment.

At this point, you want to download the files in this repository.

> - The "assignment" created for you through the GitHub Classroom UI is a private GitHub repository like any other private GitHub repo you would own.
> - You can **clone**, **push**, and **pull** to this repository using the command-line or whatever UI you prefer.
> - If you want to use git to manage your assignment (as opposed to the GitHub web UI), just **clone** your assignment repository and [skip to Part 3](#part-3-edit-the-hw0-code).

To download the starter code via the GitHub UI:
- In your homework repository (i.e. <a href="images/your-github-repo.png">this screen</a>), click the green "Clone or download" button.
<a href="images/screenshot-download.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-download.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- In the menu that pops up, click "Download ZIP"

  <img src="images/screenshot-download-zip.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>

### 3. View the starter code in a browser
{:.no_toc}

Note that **Chrome** is the recommended browser for the course, and your TAs will be grading your assignments using the Chrome browser. Please either [install and use Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) for development, or at least make sure to test your assignments in Chrome before submitting them.

- Unzip your downloaded zip file somewhere on your computer
- Open "index.html" in Chrome or another browser of your choosing.
- You should see something that looks like the following:

## Part 3: Edit the HW0 code

### 1. Download and install Atom
{:.no_toc}

_Optional: We will be using Atom in lecture, but you may use whatever text editor you'd like._

We recommend that you use the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) for CS193X.
- [Download and install Atom](https://atom.io/)

Unlike CS106A and 106B, though, it is not very important for you to use Atom if you prefer a different text editor for CS193X. However, the course staff will not provide support for any other editor besides Atom.

### 2. Fix the TODOs in `index.html`
{:.no_toc}

- In Atom (or your preferred text editor), open `index.html` and fix the TODOs.
- Here is a screenshot of an example "solution":
<a href="images/screenshot-hw0-solved.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-hw0-solved.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- If you'd like, you can further style, decorate, or modify your page to your liking. This is not required, however.

## Part 4: Upload to GitHub

Now that you've completed the homework, you should upload your files back to your Homework 0 repository.

> ### Git-speak for people who are very familiar with Git already:
> {:.no_toc}
>
> _(Please **ignore this box entirely** if you've never used git before.)_
> - If you cloned your repository via git, just commit all changes and push them to the repository on GitHub.
> - You can now [skip to Part 5](#part-5-publish-your-github-page).

- Navigate to your Homework 0 repository on GitHub (i.e. <a href="images/your-github-repo.png">this screen</a>).
- Click the "Upload files" button.
<a href="images/screenshot-upload.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-upload.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- On the next screen, select your `index.html`, `style.css`, and your image file for upload. Your screen should now look like the following:
<a href="images/screenshot-uploaded.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-uploaded.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
  - (You actually don't have to upload `style.css` again if you didn't modify it.)
- Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the green "Commit changes" button. You don't need to fill out any of the form.
<a href="images/screenshot-commit.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-commit.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- You should be redirected to the main repository screen again. The existing files should be updated and your new files should be uploaded.

## Part 5: Publish your GitHub Page
You will now publish your website as a GitHub page. This will make your website publicly accessible on the internet. (Please remember the Honor Code section of the [Course Info]({{ relative }}info) page.)

- Navigate to your Homework 0 repository on GitHub. (You should already be on this page.)
- Click the "Settings" button.
<a href="images/screenshot-settings.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-settings.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- On the Settings page, scroll down near the bottom to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under "Source", click the button that's currently set to "None"...
<a href="images/screenshot-ghpage.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-ghpage.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- ... and change it to "master branch":
<a href="images/screenshot-master-branch.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-master-branch.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- Then click "Save":
<a href="images/screenshot-page-save.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-page-save.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- The page will reload and you will be taken back to the top of the Settings screen.
- Scroll back down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and you should now see a link to your published GitHub page.
<a href="images/screenshot-published-link.png">
  <img src="images/screenshot-published-link.png" class="screenshot"/>
</a>
- Click your link to verify it is working as expected.
- Note that this is a publicly accessible link. You can send it to your friends if you want to show it off!

Note: You may notice that on the Settings page, there is an option to make the repository public. Please do not do this.
